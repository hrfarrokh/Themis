# Contribution Guidelines

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a typo
- Discussing the current state of the documents
- Submitting a issue
- Proposing new features

In order to avoid interruptions, we prefer communicating via GitLab issues, and E-mails.

## Please

1. Always start with an issue
2. Always assign merge request to one of the maintainers
3. Keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than
to side track the discussion.
